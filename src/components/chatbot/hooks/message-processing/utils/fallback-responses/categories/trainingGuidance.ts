1. Maintain a master training matrix showing:
   - Required training by job position
   - Frequency of refresher requirements
   - Certification/recertification dates
   - Regulatory standards covered

2. For each training session, document:
   - Date, location, and duration
   - Instructor name and qualifications
   - Topics covered and materials used
   - Attendee names with signatures
   - Test scores or competency verification

3. Best practices for record management:
   - Track certification expiration dates
   - Set up automated reminders for refreshers
   - Store records for employment duration plus 3 years
   - Make records accessible for regulatory inspection

Would you like me to provide a downloadable training matrix template that you can adapt for your team?`,
